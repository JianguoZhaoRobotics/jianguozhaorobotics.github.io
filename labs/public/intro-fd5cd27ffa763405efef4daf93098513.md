# MECH 529 Advanced Mechanical Systems

Welcome to the MECH 529 Advanced Mechanical Systems laboratory course at Colorado State University.

## Course Overview

This course provides hands-on experience with advanced topics in mechanical systems control, including:

- Python programming for control systems
- Ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- Control system design and analysis
- Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR)
- Trajectory tracking and generation
- Model Predictive Control (MPC)
- Reinforcement Learning (RL)

## Laboratory Exercises

The course consists of 10 laboratory exercises and a final project:

1. **Lab 1**: Python Basics
2. **Lab 2**: ODEs
3. **Lab 3**: Introduction to Python Control
4. **Lab 4**: Closed Loop Control
5. **Lab 5**: LQR (Linear Quadratic Regulator)
6. **Lab 6**: Trajectory Tracking
7. **Lab 7**: Trajectory Generation
8. **Lab 8**: Model Predictive Control
9. **Lab 9**: Value Iteration & Policy Iteration
10. **Lab 10**: Reinforcement Learning
11. **Final Project**: Acrobot

## Getting Started

Each lab is provided as a Jupyter notebook that you can download and run in your own environment. The notebooks contain both explanatory text and executable code cells.

## Prerequisites

- Basic knowledge of Python programming
- Understanding of linear algebra and differential equations
- Familiarity with control systems theory
