**I design and control adaptive robotic systems that change their morphology and behavior to operate in complex, unstructured environments.**

Dr. Jianguo Zhao received his Ph.D. in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Michigan State University in 2015; his M.E. in Mechanical Engineering from Harbin Institute of Technology, P. R. China in 2007 and B.E. in 2005. He is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State University and the director of the **Adaptive Robotics Lab**. His research focuses on adaptive and shape-morphing robotic systems that integrate mechanical design, control, and learning to achieve robust performance in real-world environments. His work spans adaptive and shape-morphing robots, multimodal locomotion and manipulation, and embodied intelligence.


Dr. Zhao’s research has resulted in over **100 peer-reviewed publications** in leading robotics and multidisciplinary venues, including *IEEE Transactions on Robotics*, *Soft Robotics*, *Nature Communications*, and *Science Advances*. He actively contributes to the robotics community through editorial service and currently serves as an **Associate Editor** for *IEEE Transactions on Robotics* and a **Technical Editor** for *IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics*.

**Research interests**
- Adaptive and shape-morphing robots  
- Multimodal locomotion and manipulation  
- Design–control–learning co-optimization  
- Embodied intelligence and physical AI
