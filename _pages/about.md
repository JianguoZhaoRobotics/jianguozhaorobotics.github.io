**I design and control adaptive robotic systems that change their morphology and behavior to operate in complex, unstructured environments.**

Dr. Jianguo Zhao is currently an Associate Professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Colorado State University and the director of the **Adaptive Robotics Lab**. His research focuses on adaptive and shape-morphing robotic systems that integrate mechanical design, control, and learning to achieve robust performance in real-world environments. His work spans adaptive and shape-morphing robots, multimodal locomotion and manipulation, and embodied intelligence.


**Highlights**
- Director, Adaptive Robotics Lab; PI/Co-PI on federally funded projects in adaptive and shape-morphing robotics
- 100+ peer-reviewed publications across robotics and multidisciplinary venues (T-RO, Soft Robotics, Nature Communications, Science Advances)
- Editorial roles: Associate Editor, IEEE Transactions on Robotics; Technical Editor, IEEE/ASME Transactions on Mechatronics
- Research themes: shape morphing, multimodal locomotion/manipulation, design–control–learning co-optimization, embodied intelligence
- Always recruiting motivated students interested in adaptive robotics and robot learning

**Education**
- Ph.D., Electrical and Computer Engineering, Michigan State University, 2015
- M.E., Mechanical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (P.R. China), 2007
- B.E., Mechanical Engineering, Harbin Institute of Technology (P.R. China), 2005
